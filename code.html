               Create your own zoo filled with animals ranging from cats to tigers, pandas, unicorns and dragons!
                But as we all know it isnÂ´t easy to keep track of all the animals, their age, gender and so on. So
                to make it easier to manage your animals "The Zoo" was created. With this software you can see all your
                animals and buy, sell, sort or check their status as you want to.

                wanted a place to reach out with their products to new and old costumers. To do that, a prototype of a
                responsive webshop was made where it is possible to see items, learn more about them and also see how
                it looks when the items are in the cart.
